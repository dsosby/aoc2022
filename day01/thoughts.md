This [cheat sheet](https://devhints.io/go) is helpful.

It's odd to go back to idiomatic imperative implementations. I'm going to hold off on using packages outside of the standard library as long as I can. I do want to try out generic libs like [this one](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/samber/lo#section-readme) as it would probably be easier.

General approach will be speed to complete, and then if I get time re-writing as idiomatic code, and thereafter refactoring for fun (performance, new library, etc).
